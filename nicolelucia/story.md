# You're walking in the woods. The forest is thick with a variety of large trees. 
## The path is narrow and earthy.
## It's very dark, so dark that you can't see in front of you.
## You come across a big, seemingly abandoned house.
# Do you want to go in?
# Y/N?

# N:
## You walk away from the house and keep going. 
## You trip on a sprawled tree root and hit your head on a large rock. 
## You suffer a fatal head injury.
## The ravens eat your lifeless body.
# You died.
# START AGAIN.

# Y:
## You go through the front door. 
## Once you go in you see a long, ominous hallway containing two doors. 
## Do you go through door 1 or 2?
# 1/2

# 1:
## You go through the strangely carved mahogany door.
## You step in a room with a wet floor and cut electrical wires everywhere.
## You are electricuted to death.
# START AGAIN.

# 2:
## You walk into a dusty, old fashioned living room.
## It's dead silent and you can hear your footsteps on the musty carpet.
## You see an old looking TV in front of you and a glass door leading to the backgarden.
## Do you go to the backgarden or switch on the TV?
# Backgarden/TV

# TV:
## You switch on the TV and static pops up on the screen. After five seconds of just static, the screen turns black.
## A little girl appears on the screen and stares at you.
## She starts running at you and comes through the screen.
## She grabs you and pulls you into the TV.
## She proceeds to rip out your intestines and eat them.
# You died.
# START AGAIN.

# Backgarden:
## You open the glass door and step out onto the chilled patio. 
## You are confronted with two options. 
## You can either go on the grass or into the shed.
## Which do you choose?
# Grass/Shed

# Grass: 
## You step onto the dewy grass and immediately get stung by a bee.
## You're allergic to bee stings and your body starts puffing up.
## Your throat slowly closes up, causing you to slowly and painfully suffocate to death.
## You died.
# START AGAIN.

# Shed:
## You walk into the wooden shed and see shelves piled with gardening tools and building tools.
## They're are cobwebs in every corner and everything is laced in dust.
## You realise there's nothing here and retreat back inside.

## You go back inside but the room has changed. 
## Now, you have a choice to either go upstairs or to the kitchen.
## Where will you go?
# Upstairs/Kitchen

# Kitchen:
## You walk into a dingy kitchen and immediately trip over a misplaced stool. 
## You fall and hit your head on the hard floor.
## Your head starts gushing blood and you bleed to death.
# START AGAIN.

# Upstairs:
## You walk up the creaky stairs and are faced with 4 doors.
## Which will you choose?
# 1/2/3/4

# 1:
## You go through door one and immediately drop dead from toxic fumes.
# START AGAIN.

# 2:
## You walk through door two and get immediately transported back to the beginning of the forest trail. 
## You can't seem to remember what just happened or why you came to the forest.
## You brush it off and turn around, back home.
# WIN?

# 3:
## You go through door three and walk into a pitch black room with a spotlight on a cloth covered table.
## You walk up to the table and a glass casing appears. 
## In it, are three diamonds.
## You open the casing and gently take them in your hand.
## You get transported  suddenly.
## You sell the diamonds and become a millionaire. 
# WIN !!

# 4:
## You walk through the fourth door and get stabbed by the house owner. 
## You get the police called on you and go to prison for breaking and entering.
## Your wound gets infected in prison and you die.
# START AGAIN.
