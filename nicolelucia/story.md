# You're walking in the woods. The forest is thick with a variety of large trees. 
## The path is narrow and earthy.
## It's very dark, so dark that you can't see in front of you.
## You come across a big, seemingly abandoned house.
# Do you want to go in?
# Y/N?

# N:
## You walk away from the house and keep going. 
## You trip on a sprawled tree root and hit your head on a large rock. 
## You suffer a fatal head injury.
## The ravens eat your lifeless body.
# You died.
# Start again.

# Y:
## You go through the front door. 
## Once you go in you see a long, ominous hallway containing two doors. 
## Do you go through door 1 or 2?
# 1/2

# 1:
## You go through the strangely carved mahogany door.
## You step in a room with a wet floor and cut electrical wires everywhere.
## You are electricuted to death.
# Start again.

#2:
## You walk into a dusty, old fashioned living room.
## It's dead silent and you can hear your footsteps on the musty carpet.
