# The Story of the Creepy House

You are walking along a narrow country what seems like hours.
You haven't seen a person or even a house for ages.

While walking you notice that a dark mysterious figure is following you, you speed up but so do they!
You decided to speed walk as fast as possible until you come across a large creepy house, you decide that going into the house is better then staying out as it is getting dark.

You run in and close the door behind you
