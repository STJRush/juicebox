# The Story of the Creepy House

You are walking along a narrow country what seems like hours.
You haven't seen a person or even a house for ages.

While walking you notice that a dark mysterious figure is following you, you speed up but so do they!
You decided to speed walk as fast as possible until you come across a large creepy house, you decide that going into the house is better then staying out as it is getting dark.

You run in and close the door behind you.
You see two door, one to the left and another to the right.

You go right and it leads to a living room so you go through the door which was on your left.

When you go through the left door you end up in the kitchen where you see two sets of stairs.
One goes upstairs and the other goes down to the basement.

You go upstairs and you see three doors.
The first one leads to a bedroom
