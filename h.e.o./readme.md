for this game the idea is simple
- You start in a jail cell
- You know that all moves are permanent 
- once you go somewhere you cant go back
- explore, die, learn, repeat

there will be three endings a good ending, a bad ending and a neutral ending
if you want to try out the current BETA stage go ahead, if you find any bugs or got ideas feel free to email [18EPojarkovas@stjosephsrush.com]
